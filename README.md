# Overview

[Pangea Chat](https://pangea.chat) is a web and mobile platform which lets students ‘learn a language while texting their friends.’ Addressing the gap in communicative language teaching, especially for beginners lacking skill and confidence, Pangea Chat provides a low-stress, high-support environment for language learning through authentic conversations. By integrating human and artificial intelligence, the app enhances communicative abilities and supports educators. Pangea Chat has been grant funded by the National Science Foundation and Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation based on its technical innovation and potential for broad social impact. Our mission is to build a global, decentralized learning network supporting intercultural learning and exchange.
