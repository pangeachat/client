# Call features session — 2026-09-04

Three call features being integrated and tested on the LAN before PRs. All
local, nothing pushed.

## Branches / commits (client repo)
- `satvik/tokenize-call-transcript` — #8797 (tap a transcript word to open its
  word card) `4b3ced372f`, cold-green + mutation-proven; #8807 v1 (single
  ringback) `0bdfeb93c4`; **#8807 3-cue `1925844ca5`** — three standard
  telephony cues (ringback placing / call.ogg reconnecting / end tone on cut),
  owner heard and approved the sounds locally. Tests: transcript_tokens (5),
  ring_player (generation-token race), call_session (rewritten ringback group).
  The 3-cue commit is NOT cold-gated yet — owner approval was on the SOUND;
  the cold gate is the pre-push bar, run it before the #8807 PR.
- `satvik/call-audio-recording` — each device saves its own call audio to the
  room at the finish seam (`pangea.call_audio`, plain mxc url since rooms are
  unencrypted, write gated on `carriedOn`); offline merge tool
  `tools/merge_call_audio/`. The phone APK was built from here (recording-only:
  no #8797/#8807).
- `satvik/call-features-combined` — merge of the two above, TEST INTEGRATION
  ONLY (not a PR). Base merge `d7f3ff642a`, then the 3-cue merged in clean.
  Both features coexist (recording + 3-cue markers both present), calls surface
  analyzes clean.

## Served for testing NOW
- Combined web build #2 (all 3 features, tones bundled, LAN `.env`) served at
  **http://192.168.1.156:8091** from `combined/build/web` (python http.server,
  bg task `bnexnpkj5`). Rebuilt clean (`rm -rf build/web` first) so no stale
  bundle in the artefact — but the BROWSER can still serve a cached SW bundle,
  so the tester must hard-refresh / use a fresh window.
- LAN call path fully green: advertised focus `http://192.168.1.156:7980`,
  lk-jwt `LIVEKIT_URL=ws://192.168.1.156:7880`, SFU :7880 -> 200, Synapse :8008
  -> 200, lk-jwt :7980/healthz -> 200. Accounts @learner and @rectest /
  learnerpass both log in (200).
- Test shape: laptop (:8091, all 3 features) is the CALLER so it hears the 3
  cues; phone (recording APK) answers and records its half. Word-cards are
  viewable on the laptop transcript. The recordings player is NOT in this build.

## Done since (2026-09-04, live test round)
- **Word-card bug fixed** `c6460b66d9` on `satvik/tokenize-call-transcript`.
  Symptom (owner saw it on the LAN test): the card opened from a call
  transcript had a DOUBLE border and a clipped definition, unlike the normal
  message card. Root cause: `PositionedOverlayDisplayDetails.addBorder`
  defaults to `true`, so `showPositionedCard` wraps the card in a bordered
  `OverlayContainer` (overlay_container.dart draws `Border.all` + radius 25) —
  but `WordZoomWidget` already draws its OWN border (word_zoom_widget.dart:173)
  and OverlayContainer's constraints crop its fixed height. The RULE: a
  `WordZoomWidget` shown via `showPositionedCard` must set `addBorder: false`
  (the widget owns its border). The only other such site (activity_vocab
  widget) already does; #8797 was the one that didn't. Fix also turns on
  `enableEmojiSelection` + `enableAnalyticsNavigation` (the default card carries
  them; both need no event) — reactions + report-flag stay off (a transcript
  has no room message event). analyze clean, 5 transcript_tokens tests green.
  NOT visually re-verified in-session (needs a live call) — owner verifies on
  the rebuild.
- **Recordings player merged.** Agent `aa4e66aebd4a7ed9d` finished:
  `24203fd711` on `satvik/call-audio-recording` — `call_audio_repo.dart`
  (`fetchCallAudio`, mirrors `fetchCallTranscript`'s relations walk on the same
  `callKey`) + a "Recordings" section below the transcript in
  `CallTranscriptView`, one `AudioPlayerWidget` per `pangea.call_audio` event.
  Reuse detail: the raw event type isn't `m.room.message`, so
  `downloadAndDecryptAttachment` would throw; the agent feeds a SYNTHETIC
  `m.audio` message event carrying the same plain mxc url to the unmodified
  player. Mutation-proven tests (both directions), 1410 calls tests green.
  NOT cold-gated yet — gate before the recording PR.
- Both merged into combined clean (no conflicts): card fix + player + 3-cue.
  gen-l10n run for the new `callTranscriptRecordings` key; calls analyze clean.
  Combined build #3 building (bg `b8766xeif`) -> re-serve on :8091.

## Next
1. Build #3 lands -> re-serve :8091 -> owner re-tests the word card (single
   border, uncropped) and the recordings player on the live call.
2. Cold-gate, before the PRs (pre-push bar): the 3-cue `1925844ca5` + card fix
   `c6460b66d9` (#8797/#8807 branch), and the recordings player `24203fd711`
   (recording branch). None gated yet.
3. #8808 (transcript loading state) still queued — needs the "still processing"
   signal decision (current lean: listen + settle, not a spinner-forever).
4. PRs #8797 + #8807 await owner PR-go; batch-merge with the recording work as
   one deploy on owner go.
